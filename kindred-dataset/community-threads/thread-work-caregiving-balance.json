I've been trying to manage both for seven months and I think I'm breaking.\n\nI'm in sales—client calls, presentations, travel sometimes. But I'm also managing Dad's medications, taking him to appointments (he had FOUR medical appointments last week), and handling his meals and evening routine because we can't afford full-time help.\n\nLast Tuesday I had to leave a client meeting mid-presentation because Dad fell. My boss said \"of course, family first\" but I could see his face. I'm already on thin ice from missed deadlines last month.\n\nI work until 10 or 11 most nights to catch up. My wife barely sees me. I had chest pains last week that were probably stress but I haven't had time to get them checked.\n\nI can't quit—we need my salary and the insurance. But I don't know how much longer I can do this. Is anyone actually making this work?"

      "body": "Mark, I've been doing this for two years with my mother-in-law. \"Making it work\" might be too strong—surviving it, maybe.\n\nFew things that helped:\n\nFMLA. If you haven't looked into it, you can use it intermittently for appointments rather than taking a full leave. It protects your job even if your boss is frustrated. You have rights here.\n\nI eventually had a very direct conversation with my boss where I laid out exactly what I was dealing with. Not apologizing, just explaining and then asking what flexibility was possible. We restructured some of my responsibilities. Not every job allows this, I know.\n\nBut honestly? The thing that actually helped most was hiring help, which I know you said you can't afford. We started with just three mornings a week of a home health aide. It was tight financially. We cut other things. But I was so depleted that the alternative was me quitting or collapsing.\n\nI'm not saying my way is the answer. But you mentioned chest pains—please take that seriously. You can't help your dad from a hospital bed."

      "body": "Mark, I'm also in a demanding career while caregiving. A few tactical things:\n\n1. Batch appointments. I worked with my mom's doctors to schedule multiple visits on the same day. One day off instead of four scattered half-days.\n\n2. Telehealth for everything possible. Most routine check-ins don't need to be in person.\n\n3. I stopped being reactive with my boss and started being proactive. I send a weekly email on Monday with my availability and any appointments that week. No surprises. It actually helped my reputation because I looked organized instead of chaotic.\n\n4. Any family who can take something? My brother lives across the country but he handles all the insurance paperwork now. That alone saved me hours each week.\n\nBut I want to be honest—I'm also exhausted. I don't have a magic answer. I've just found ways to be slightly less underwater."

I've been burning PTO for every doctor visit and I'm almost out.\n\nDavid, the batching idea makes sense. I've just been taking whatever appointment slot they offered. Didn't occur to me to push back.\n\nCarol, we can't do even three mornings a week financially—I've looked at the numbers. But maybe once a week? I'll look again.\n\nRe: the chest pains—I know. My wife keeps saying the same thing. I'll try to get in somewhere this week.\n\nTime for myself? What's that? I genuinely don't remember the last time I did something that wasn't work or caregiving or sleeping. Maybe watching TV while answering emails counts?"

This week, not \"when I have time.\"\n\nOn the Parkinson's appointments specifically—once the disease is more stable, the frequency usually decreases. In the adjustment phase there are tons of visits, but it doesn't stay that way forever. Ask his neurologist about spacing things out if he's been on his current regimen for a while.\n\nAlso, does your dad qualify for any in-home support through Medicaid or veterans benefits? A lot of people don't know what's available. Might be worth a call to your local Area Agency on Aging to ask.\n\nI hear your financial constraints. But I also know what happens when caregivers crash. The cost of that is higher than the cost of help."

When I finally calculated what caregiving was costing me in stress, health, and the money I was spending on convenience because I had no time... the math was closer than I expected.\n\nI went to 32 hours a week for six months. It was tight. We ate a lot of rice and beans. But I stopped feeling like I was going to have a breakdown.\n\nNot saying it's right for you. Just that \"I can't afford it\" sometimes means \"I haven't looked at all the options.\" And sometimes it really does mean you can't afford it. Only you know."

That scared me.\n\nI talked to my boss. Actually talked, not apologized. Showed him what I was dealing with. He didn't offer to restructure my role but he did agree to no travel for the next two months while I figure things out. It's something.\n\nI called about veterans benefits—my dad served in Korea. There might be some Aid and Attendance money we qualify for. Still sorting through the paperwork.\n\nI also talked to my wife about whether 32 hours could work. We're not sure yet. It would mean some real sacrifices. But she pointed out that if I collapse, we have zero income instead of reduced income.\n\nI'm not going to pretend I've solved anything. I'm still exhausted. But I feel like I have a few things to try instead of just drowning. Thank you for making me feel less crazy for struggling with this."

Zero income is worse than reduced income. I've seen too many caregivers sacrifice themselves completely and then have nothing left to give.\n\nYou haven't solved it, but you're problem-solving instead of just surviving. That's different. That's progress.\n\nKeep us posted."
