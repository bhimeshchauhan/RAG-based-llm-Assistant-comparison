      "body": "Posting this at 7:43am because I'm already exhausted and the day hasn't even started.\n\nMy husband has mid-stage Alzheimer's. Getting him up, bathed, dressed, and fed takes 2-3 hours every single morning. This morning he refused to put his arms through his shirt sleeves. Yesterday he got angry when I tried to help with his pants. The day before that he wouldn't get out of bed at all until almost 10.\n\nBy the time we're done I have nothing left. And then there's the whole rest of the day.\n\nPeople keep telling me mornings can be smoother. That there are tricks. I've read the articles. But when he's standing there confused and I'm trying to hand him his toothbrush for the fourth time, nothing I've read seems to apply.\n\nWhat am I missing?"

      "body": "Nancy, I remember those mornings with my mom. Some things that helped—not fixed, helped:\n\nSlow way down. I know 2-3 hours already feels forever, but rushing makes it worse. When I accepted that morning routine just IS the morning, something shifted. I stopped trying to get through it and started just being in it.\n\nMinimal choices. Don't ask \"what do you want to wear?\" Lay out one outfit. Hand him one thing at a time.\n\nSame order every single day. Even if he doesn't consciously remember the routine, part of his brain might recognize it.\n\nIs bathing the hardest part? For my mom it was. I eventually moved showers to evening when she was calmer. There's no rule that says bathing has to be morning.\n\nBut I also want to be honest—some mornings nothing worked. I'd do everything \"right\" and she'd still fight me. That's the disease, not you."

When I'm stressed and hurrying—even if I'm trying to hide it—he picks up on it and resists more.\n\nI started doing a few minutes of deep breathing in the hallway before going to help him. Sounds silly, I know. But when I walk in calmer, he responds better. Not always, but more often.\n\nMusic helped us too. I play his old big band favorites while we get ready. Sometimes he hums along. The whole energy is different.\n\nWhat doesn't work for us: trying to explain or reason with him about why he needs to do something. That just escalates things."

      "body": "Nancy, for the medication resistance specifically—have you tried changing how you give them? My husband fought pills until we switched his most important one to liquid and put it in his morning smoothie. He has no idea.\n\nI also learned to set out clothes the night before in the exact order he puts them on, with buttons already undone and zippers open. Fewer steps = less confusion = less fighting.\n\nBut I want to gently push back on one thing—the idea that there's a trick you're missing. Sometimes there isn't. Sometimes the disease just makes everything hard and there's no magic approach that fixes it. You're not failing if things don't get smooth."

Maybe I've been fighting against his natural rhythm.\n\nPatrick, the music idea is worth trying. He loved Frank Sinatra. I have his old records somewhere.\n\nDiane, \"just being in it\" instead of trying to get through it—that reframe helps somehow. Even if nothing practical changes, maybe I can stop feeling so frantic.\n\nMargaret, thank you for saying there might not be a trick I'm missing. I keep thinking I'm doing something wrong. Maybe sometimes it's just hard and that's it."

      "body": "Nancy, one more thought: have you looked into whether a home health aide could help with mornings? Even just a couple days a week.\n\nSometimes—and I know this sounds backwards—people with dementia cooperate better with someone who isn't their spouse. My mom actually let the aide help her with things she'd fight me on. Something about the family dynamic.\n\nI know aides cost money. And finding a good one takes time. But if you can swing it, having someone else handle personal care might transform mornings for both of you."

Not the whole time, and he still got confused, but there was no fighting. We were done by 9:30 instead of 10:30.\n\nIt didn't work as well the next few days. Wednesday was still a battle. Thursday okay. Friday terrible—he wouldn't even get out of bed.\n\nBut Monday it worked again. I'm learning that nothing works every time. Some days are just hard no matter what.\n\nHaven't tried evening baths yet. Still working up to changing the routine that much. Baby steps.\n\nThank you for being here. It helps to have somewhere to report back to."
