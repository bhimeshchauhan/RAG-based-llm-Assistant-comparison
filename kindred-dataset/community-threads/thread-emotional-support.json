      "body": "I'm sitting in my car in the Walgreens parking lot crying and I don't know where else to put this.\n\nI drove across town during my lunch break to get my mom's groceries. She has vascular dementia and she's been having a hard week. I thought I was being thoughtful. I got her favorite crackers, the good bread, everything on her list.\n\nI get there and she screams at me. SCREAMS. For twenty minutes. Because I got the store brand saltines instead of the name brand. Her aide was standing right there. I just stood there taking it while this woman who used to be my mother called me thoughtless and selfish and said I don't care about her.\n\nI know it's the disease. I KNOW. But she grabbed the crackers and threw them on the floor and something in me just broke.\n\nI love her. And I don't like her right now. And I feel horrible for saying that.\n\nI have to go back to work in 15 minutes. I don't know how I'm going to pretend to be a functional human."

That's love, even when it gets thrown back at you.\n\nYou're allowed to love someone and not like them right now. You're allowed to miss who she used to be. You're allowed to be angry and sad and exhausted all at once.\n\nTake a few more minutes in that car if you can. Cry. Then go back to work and do the best you can. That's all any of us can do.\n\nThe crackers don't matter. You showing up matters. Even when she can't see it."

More than I want to admit.\n\nSomething my therapist told me that I come back to: \"You can love someone and not like them in that moment.\" That doesn't make you a bad daughter. It makes you a human being dealing with an inhumanly hard situation.\n\nThe disease has taken your real mom. You're grieving her while still caring for her body. That's an impossible position to be in and you're doing it anyway.\n\nGive yourself grace. Even when it's hard to find."

His own daughter, who quit her job to care for him. I know it's the disease but I cried for an hour.\n\nI've started writing myself notes on the hard days: \"This is the disease talking, not Dad. I'm a good daughter. I'm doing my best.\" Sometimes I read them when I need a reminder.\n\nYou ARE a good daughter. She won't remember the crackers. But the love behind your visit still matters—to her on some level, and to you."

The mom I knew would never have spoken to me like that. That person is already gone, even though she's still physically here.\n\nI'm going to dry my eyes and go back. Knowing you all are out there dealing with your own cracker moments helps more than you know."
