      "body": "It's 9am and I've already failed at today. My mom moved in six months ago after her stroke. I'm also home with my 2.5 year old and 4 year old.\n\nYesterday my toddler threw herself on the kitchen floor screaming for twenty minutes while I was trying to help my mom transfer to her wheelchair. Mom was half-standing, I couldn't let go, and Lily was just lying there shrieking because I'd given her the wrong color cup. I finally got Mom seated and just stood there between them not knowing who to go to first.\n\nI know Lily's picking up on my stress. I know the tantrums are probably her asking for connection. But I physically cannot give everyone what they need at the same time. This morning she bit her sister because I was helping Mom with breakfast.\n\nI feel like I'm failing all three of them. Has anyone done this—little kids and caregiving at the same time? I don't even know what I'm asking for. Maybe just someone to tell me this is survivable."

      "body": "Sarah, I did this. When my father-in-law lived with us, my kids were 3 and 6. It was the hardest year of my life, no exaggeration.\n\nTwo things helped—not solved, helped:\n\nWe made a \"grandpa time box\" for the kids with special toys and books that only came out during his care times. The novelty bought us maybe 20 minutes of focused time. Not always, but sometimes.\n\nMy older one actually liked having small jobs—bringing grandpa his water cup, handing me the washcloth. She felt included instead of pushed aside. The 3 year old was too young for that though, so it was really just about survival with him.\n\nI'm not going to tell you it gets easier exactly. But you adjust. You find workarounds. You lower the bar on what counts as a good day.\n\nYou're not failing. You're doing three impossible things at once."

What I've started doing is narrating for her: \"Mommy is helping Grandpa sit down right now. In five minutes we'll play.\" She doesn't really understand time but it seems to help her know I haven't forgotten her.\n\nBut honestly? Some days it doesn't work at all. Last Thursday she cried through his entire lunch and I just had to let her cry. I felt horrible. He felt horrible. Everyone was miserable.\n\nI keep telling myself \"good enough is good enough\" but I don't always believe it."

I know that might feel like too much to coordinate, but when my mom went even two mornings a week, it gave me time to actually be present with my kids. They're older than yours but I remember how much they needed that undivided attention.\n\nMy mom resisted at first—she said she wasn't \"that kind of old.\" But after about a month she actually started looking forward to it. The social piece was good for her.\n\nI realize that's not helpful for tomorrow morning though. Just something to consider."

I think Lily does feel pushed aside. She used to be the baby and now there's this whole other person who needs me.\n\nMichael, adult day programs feel overwhelming to research right now but I wrote it down. Maybe my husband can look into it this weekend.\n\nElla—\"good enough is good enough.\" I'm going to try to believe it too.\n\nThe guilt is the worst part. I constantly feel like I'm shortchanging everyone. My mom. The kids. My husband who's stretched thin covering for me. There's not enough of me to go around."

      "body": "Just want to gently push back on one thing—the adult day program idea is great but it's not nothing to coordinate, especially with little kids. You'd have to get your mom ready and transported, which means managing the kids during that window or finding coverage. And they're not cheap.\n\nI'm not saying don't do it, just that it's not a simple fix. When people suggested it to me I felt like I was failing for not jumping on it immediately. It took me three months to actually make it happen.\n\nWhat helped me more immediately was finding a college student who could come for two hours twice a week, specifically during mom's PT exercises. Way cheaper than a home health aide and she was great with the kids too. They'd do crafts while I focused on mom.\n\nIs there anyone like that available near you? Even a neighbor's teenager?"

It worked great on Monday and Tuesday—Lily was so excited about the special crayons that she drew quietly for almost 30 minutes. Wednesday she dumped the whole box on the floor and had a meltdown anyway. Thursday she forgot it existed. Friday we didn't even try because everyone was sick.\n\nI also asked my neighbor's 16 year old if she could come by sometimes. She said yes but she has volleyball practice most days so it'll be weekends only. It's something though.\n\nI'm not going to pretend everything is better. But I feel slightly less alone in it, which helps more than I expected. Thanks for being here."
