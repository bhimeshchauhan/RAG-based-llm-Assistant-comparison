      "body": "I've been reading some really heavy threads today. All valid, all important. But I could use some good news.\n\nCan we share wins? Big or small. What's going right, even if it's just one thing?\n\nI'll start: My mom has pretty advanced dementia. She usually doesn't know who I am. But today she looked at me while I was brushing her hair and said \"Patricia, you're so good to me.\"\n\nMy name. She said my name. For the first time in months.\n\nI sat in the car afterward and cried for twenty minutes. Happy tears, for once.\n\nWhat's your win?"

      "body": "Pat, that made ME tear up. Those moments of clarity are gifts.\n\nMy win: After MONTHS of refusing, my dad finally agreed to let a home health aide help with showers. He was so resistant—said he wasn't going to let a stranger see him naked. I thought it would never happen.\n\nThe aide we found is a former Marine like him. First visit, they spent ten minutes talking about their service before even getting started. Dad actually laughed. He asked when \"that guy\" was coming back.\n\nIt's such a weight off. And proof that the right match makes all the difference."

Didn't check my phone once.\n\nA year ago I would have felt too guilty to do that. Yesterday I did it and I came back actually refreshed instead of empty.\n\nThe mental shift—accepting that I need breaks and deserve them—that's the real win."

Just the walker. No wheelchair. No me hovering right beside her.\n\nHalfway there she looked back at me and grinned. Like a kid who just learned to ride a bike.\n\nIt's not a cure. It might not last. Tomorrow might be harder. But today, right now, that walk happened. And I'm going to hold onto it."

He actually listened.\n\nWe came up with a plan. He's going to contribute more financially. I stay as primary caregiver. We check in monthly so nothing builds up.\n\nWe're not perfect. But we're functioning as a team again instead of adversaries. That feels like the biggest win of all."

I've been tracking it on paper and making mistakes.\n\nNow I have alarms. Color-coded. With notes about which ones need food. I haven't missed a dose in two weeks.\n\nTechnology win. Took me way too long, but I got there."
