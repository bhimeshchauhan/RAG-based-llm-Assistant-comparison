      "body": "I need to talk about the money because it's keeping me up at night.\n\nMy parents both need care. Mom has advanced Parkinson's, Dad is showing early Alzheimer's signs. Neither of them planned for this. They have Social Security and a small pension—maybe $3,200/month combined. Their medications alone cost $600.\n\nI've already spent most of my savings. Bathroom grab bars, wheelchair ramp, hiring someone to stay with them when I couldn't be there, covering prescriptions insurance doesn't pay for. I just hit $22,000 in credit card debt.\n\nMy sister says she \"can't help financially.\" She makes more than I do.\n\nNow I'm looking at possibly needing to move one or both of them to a facility. I looked up memory care costs in our area. SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. For one person. How do people pay that? There's no way. We can't.\n\nI feel like I'm drowning and no one told me the water was coming."

      "body": "William, I hear you. The financial reality is brutal and most families are blindsided by it.\n\nSome things to look into:\n\n1. Medicaid. It's the main program that pays for long-term care for people with limited assets. Your parents would need to \"spend down\" to qualify, but there are legal ways to protect some resources. An elder law attorney can explain options.\n\n2. Veterans benefits. If either parent served, they may qualify for Aid and Attendance. It's not huge money but it helps.\n\n3. Your Area Agency on Aging. They can tell you about local programs—sometimes there's help people don't know about.\n\n4. Regarding your sister: \"can't\" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. Maybe she can't match your spending. But can she take on the insurance calls? Manage the paperwork? Contribute something even if it's less than you?\n\nNone of this is quick or easy. But you're not out of options yet."

      "body": "Adding to Mary's advice—\n\nOn facility costs: some have tiered pricing based on care level. A facility that's $7K for memory care might be $4K for assisted living. It's still a lot but it's different math.\n\nSome non-profit facilities have funds for people who outlive their resources. Worth asking about.\n\nAlso look into Medicaid waiver programs in your state—they sometimes pay for home care, which is often cheaper than facility care and might keep your parents home longer.\n\nOn the sister: I know this is hard, but you may need to be very direct about what's sustainable. \"I can't keep doing this alone\" is a complete sentence. If she still won't help, at least you'll know where you stand."

      "body": "Thank you both. This at least gives me somewhere to start. I've been so overwhelmed I couldn't even figure out what questions to ask.\n\nI didn't know about the Medicaid spend-down rules. Or that there are attorneys who specialize in this. I also didn't know about veterans benefits—my dad did serve in Korea. I'll look into that.\n\nThe conversation with my sister... I've been avoiding it. She gets defensive every time money comes up. But you're right that I need to try. Even if she can't give money, maybe she can take something off my plate.\n\nI'm going to look up elder law attorneys today. I assume they're expensive but maybe the consultation is free?"

      "body": "William, many elder law attorneys do offer free consultations, or a low flat fee for the first meeting. It's worth it—they know things you can't figure out on your own.\n\nThe attorney who helped us was about $2,500 total but she saved us way more than that by helping structure things so my mom qualified for Medicaid without us losing everything.\n\nOn your sister: when you talk to her, try leading with \"I need help\" instead of \"you're not doing enough.\" I know it feels unfair when you're doing everything, but keeping the relationship intact matters for the long haul.\n\nThis is genuinely one of the hardest parts of caregiving. The financial piece breaks families."

Turns out she genuinely hadn't understood how bad things were—I'd been shielding her from the details. When I showed her the actual numbers she got quiet.\n\nShe can't contribute much money (she has her own debt, which I didn't know about). But she's going to take over all the insurance and Medicare paperwork, which has been eating hours of my time every week. It's not nothing.\n\nI have a consultation with an elder law attorney on Tuesday. I'm also looking into the veterans benefits—the paperwork is confusing but there's a county office that helps with applications.\n\nI'm not going to pretend everything is solved. I still don't know how we'll pay for memory care if it comes to that. But I feel slightly less like I'm facing this completely alone.\n\nThank you for listening and for the concrete suggestions. Sometimes you need someone to tell you there are actually options."
