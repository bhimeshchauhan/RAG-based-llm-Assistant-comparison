I've been walking around in a fog ever since.\n\nThe neurologist said we should \"get our affairs in order\" while she still has capacity to make decisions. Then he handed us a pamphlet and we left. That's it. That's all the guidance we got.\n\nI'm the oldest of three kids. My brother lives across the country. My sister is in the middle of a divorce. Everyone's looking at me to figure this out.\n\nI don't even know what questions to ask. Legal stuff? Financial stuff? What about when she gets worse? What do people even plan for?\n\nI've been Googling at 2am and just getting more overwhelmed. Where do I actually start?"

Here's what I wish someone had told me:\n\nLEGAL - Do these NOW while she has capacity:\n- Power of Attorney for finances (who can manage her money when she can't)\n- Healthcare Power of Attorney (who makes medical decisions when she can't)\n- Living Will / Advance Directive (what does she want regarding end-of-life care)\n- HIPAA authorization (who can access her medical info)\n\nFind an elder law attorney. Yes it costs money. It's worth it.\n\nFINANCIAL - Start now, figure out more over time:\n- What are her assets and income?\n- How will care be paid for?\n- Learn about Medicaid (there's a 5-year lookback for eligibility, so decisions now matter)\n\nCARE PLANNING - This evolves:\n- Who will be primary caregiver?\n- What does she want as things progress?\n- At what point would she consider outside help? A facility?\n\nIt's overwhelming. Don't try to do it all at once. But the legal stuff is urgent because capacity can change."

      "body": "Adding to Christine's excellent list:\n\nHAVE THE HARD CONVERSATIONS NOW. While your mom can still participate in decisions, ask her what she actually wants. Does she want to stay home as long as possible? Would she prefer a facility at some point? What matters most to her about quality of life?\n\nThese conversations are difficult. My mom cried. I cried. But I'm so grateful now to know what she would have wanted.\n\nALSO: Include your siblings. I know your sister is going through a divorce and your brother is far away, but caregiving destroys families when people don't communicate. Have a meeting—video call is fine—about expectations and roles. Who can do what? Who can contribute financially? Get it out in the open early.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association has free resources and support groups. You don't have to figure this out alone."

I'll look for elder law attorneys this week.\n\nThe conversation with Mom about what she wants... that's going to be hard. She's still processing the diagnosis herself. She keeps saying \"maybe the doctors are wrong.\" But you're right that we need to have it before we can't.\n\nThe sibling meeting is overdue. We've all been avoiding it because it's uncomfortable. But I can already see the potential for resentment building.\n\nIs there a resource on Kindred specifically about the legal and financial stuff? I saw someone mention it but want to find it."

It might take multiple conversations. You don't have to get everything resolved at once. Just start.\n\nAlso consider finding a support group specifically for early-stage families. The concerns at this point are different from later stages, and it helps to talk to people in the same boat."

It starts with missing your own doctor appointments, skipping exercise, saying no to friends. Then suddenly you're depleted and can't give anymore.\n\nBuild in boundaries and self-care from the beginning. It's not selfish—it's what lets you keep doing this over the long haul.\n\nYou're handling this well by asking for help early. A lot of families wait until crisis."
