      "body": "My dad has congestive heart failure. He had some tests last Tuesday and we're waiting for results. I cannot function.\n\nEvery time my phone buzzes I feel my whole body tense. I check my email constantly. Last night I woke up at 3am and couldn't fall back asleep because I kept thinking about what the cardiologist might say.\n\nI snapped at my daughter this morning over nothing. I made a mistake at work yesterday that I had to spend an hour fixing. I sat in my car after dropping the kids off and cried for ten minutes before I could drive.\n\nI know that worrying doesn't change the results. I know that. But I can't stop my brain from running worst-case scenarios on repeat. It's like I'm pre-grieving something that hasn't happened and might not happen.\n\nDoes anyone else do this? How do you get through the waiting?"

      "body": "\"Pre-grieving something that hasn't happened\" — yes. I call it scanxiety with my husband (he has cancer). The weeks between scans are unbearable.\n\nWhat helps me sometimes: trying to stay in the present moment. Right now, today, your dad is here. Right now, you don't have bad news. The terrible thing you're imagining might not happen.\n\nI know that's easier to say than do. I'm not great at it. But when I catch myself spiraling, I try to redirect: \"I will handle whatever comes when it comes. I don't have to pre-live it.\"\n\nI also started seeing a therapist when my husband was diagnosed. It's the one hour a week where I can fall apart with someone whose job it is to help me put myself back together.\n\nThe waiting is genuinely terrible. You're not overreacting."

      "body": "I care for my mom with COPD. Every time she coughs more than usual or seems tired, I spiral.\n\nSomething that helped me—I asked her pulmonologist to give me specific parameters. Like: if her oxygen drops below 88, call. If she has these specific symptoms, go to the ER. Otherwise, it's probably okay.\n\nHaving concrete guidelines helped me stop treating every small thing as an emergency. I still worry, but I have something external to check against instead of just my anxiety.\n\nMaybe you could ask your dad's cardiologist for something similar? What should you actually be watching for vs. normal variation?\n\nI wish I could tell you how to not be anxious. I haven't figured that out. Just ways to manage it so it doesn't completely take over."

Maybe I need to prioritize it.\n\nTom, the parameters idea is really helpful. I've been treating every single thing as a potential crisis. Maybe knowing what actually warrants worry would help me not catastrophize everything.\n\nThe weird thing is I know I've done this before—spent a week in agony waiting for results that came back fine. You'd think I'd learn. But every time feels like the time it won't be fine."

It doesn't make the worry disappear, but it takes the edge off enough that I can function.\n\nCaregiving is a legitimate medical reason to need extra support. It's not weakness.\n\nAlso, when I'm in the waiting period, I try to keep myself busy with things that require actual concentration. Puzzles. A show with a complicated plot I have to follow. Something that takes my brain elsewhere. It's not a solution but it helps pass the time.\n\nDistraction isn't avoidance when you literally can't do anything else."

I put myself through a week of agony for news that was basically \"no change.\" And I know in three months I'll do it all over again.\n\nI'm going to look into therapy. Maybe also talk to my own doctor about medication. I can't keep living like this between every appointment.\n\nThank you for listening. It helped to not be alone in the waiting."

This isn't sustainable without more support—and that's not a you problem, it's a this-situation-is-objectively-hard problem.\n\nWe'll be here in three months too."
